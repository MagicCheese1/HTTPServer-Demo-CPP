    <h1>Hello world!</h1>
    <p>I hate C! and C++ is even worse :|<p>
    <p>This project got me depressed. Very depressed.<p>
    <p>THE CODE IS A HACKY SPAGHETTI MESS. I'M SORRY FOR THAT. I HAVE NO CLUE WHAT I'M DOING!<p>
    <p>For some reason Postman doesn't like this even though chrome handles it well. Can't be bothered to figure it
        out.<p>
    <p>Gotta admit did have some fun<p>
